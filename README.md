- **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
  Purpose of the app:
  This is a simple address book app built with Rails and Bootstrap, using the Devise gem to handle user authentication.

This app was created to be a web-based, password-protected version of the family address book spreadsheet I've kept for many years. This way, when family members inevitably text me for others' addresses (because they know I kept that spreadsheet), I can instead give them credentials to this site. Much simpler, particularly during Christmas card season!

- **Languages/Tools Used:**
  Node.js, Express.js, Javascript, Mustache, HTML/CSS, Heroku, ElephantSQL
