# ADDRESS BOOK

(Please be aware, this site is currently hosted on the free tier of Heroku. It may take up to 15 seconds to initially load if its server is asleep.)

This is a simple address book app built with Rails and Bootstrap, using the Devise gem to handle user authentication.

To see the site in action with a few fictional addresses, log in

The intent behind this app was to create a web-based, password-protected version of the family address book spreadsheet I've kept for many years, so when family members inevitably text me for others' addresses (knowing I kept the spreadsheet), I can instead give them credentials to this site. Much simpler, particularly during Christmas card season!
