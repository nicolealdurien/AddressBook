# ADDRESS BOOK

This is a simple address book app built with Rails and Bootstrap, using the Devise gem to handle user authentication. The intent behind this app was to create a web-based, password-protected version of the family address book spreadsheet I've kept for many years, so when family members inevitably text me for others' addresses (knowing I kept the spreadsheet), I can instead give them credentials to this site. Much simpler, particularly during Christmas card season!
