  (Please be aware, this site is currently hosted on the free tier of Heroku. It may take up to 15 seconds to initially load if its server is asleep.)

  To see the site in action with a few fictional addresses, sign in using the following credentials:
  Email: guest@guestaccount.com<br />
  Password: guest123

<br />

- **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>

  This is a simple address book app built with Rails and Bootstrap, using the Devise gem to handle user authentication.

  This app was created to be a web-based, password-protected version of the family address book spreadsheet I've kept for many years. This way, when family members inevitably text me for others' addresses (because they know I kept that spreadsheet), I can instead give them credentials to this site. Much simpler, particularly during Christmas card season!

- **Features:**

  Registration and login available for individual users. Users can update their profile page (change email or password) or delete their account when signed in.

  Users can create an address book visible only to them. They can add new contacts, edit existing contacts, or delete contacts.

* **Languages/Tools Used:**
  Ruby/Rails, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Heroku
